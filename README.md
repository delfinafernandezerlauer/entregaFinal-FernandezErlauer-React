React E-Commerce App with Vite, Firebase, Material-UI, and Bootstrap
Welcome to the React E-Commerce App! This is a modern e-commerce application built using React, Vite, Google Firebase for its database, and styled with Material-UI and Bootstrap. This app features a catalog, category navigation, product detail pages with an "Add to Cart" feature, a shopping cart component with a summary, a checkout component displaying the total amount, and a form for user details before the final checkout.




# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
